# moonterminal
a terrible terminal in python

this terminal only carries a few basic commands:
--land--
SL print command


--create--
kinda wonky right now but it creates files and adds appends the text after the the filnename to the file


--open--
opens any file of your choice(note: it must be in working directory of the terminal code)


--delete--
deletes file(same note as last time)

 
--wait--
waits a given time


--username--
changes the username of the currently active session


--==DISCLAIMER==--
this is not a fully functioning terminal, please do not use this for any serious matters(not that you will but this is to all my funny freinds out their).
